# Cloud-Terraform-DevOps

This presentation document serves as an introductory guide to Cloud Computing, aimed at helping beginners build a solid foundation. It starts with the fundamentals, including the shared responsibility model, benefits of using cloud services, cloud service hierarchy, and cost analysis.

It also provides an overview of the various types of cloud services, followed by a step-by-step walkthrough of deploying a resource via the cloud portalâ€”ideal for those new to cloud platforms who want to understand how deployments work visually.

Moving beyond the portal, the presentation explores deployment tools, with a strong focus on Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. It covers essential Terraform concepts, key commands, and how to use Terraform to define and provision infrastructure through code.

To bring everything together, the document introduces Azure DevOps, detailing core components such as Boards, Repositories, Pipelines, Test Plans, and Artifacts. It concludes with a practical section on building CI/CD pipelines from scratch and deploying resources using Azure DevOps.
